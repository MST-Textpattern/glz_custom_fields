* input values filter before values are saved, exclude ' " from filtering:
  I just want to point out that there still is a problem with ' character (single quote). I can substitute it with apostrophe ', and that work fine, so there is a workaround. But for a client this could be a difficult thing to remember (the keyboard doesn't offer a stroke for that).

* search form needs a fieldset to validate

* more versatile search button for the filtering form

* I installed and everything is working fine, with one exception. It seems like I can't enter values with spaces inside (i.e., Moggio Torinese, as a single value for checkboxes). Similar problem for special characthers like '. I can use "Moggio Torinese" (with quotes), but then the whole string, " included, are shown in the content interface.
  I'm sure there is a way to have these character stored in the db without sql syntax problem, but I don't know what it is! :). Maurizio - maurizio.boscarol@gmail.com

* split custom fields with a custom delimiter, not only |

* Is there any way to limit the length of the multiple choice areas? I have big names on some of them and they expand the admin layout. Gon√ßalo Dumas - goncalo.dumas@gmail.com
