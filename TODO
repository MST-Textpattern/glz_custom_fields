== V1.2.1 ==

* searches can either be displayed on the current page or on search section (user-configurable)

* sort values alphabetically or as they were entered

* Also, I am using the the_video plugin which has an one- or two-letter code for each video host option. Is it possible to have the name of the video host show up in the dropdown but output the code instead of the name when the custom field is called up? For example, a selection of "Google Video" would store and eventually output the value "G". - Alicia Lane - alicialane@gmail.com

* in the search form, enable users to set inputs for sections & custom fields (?!)

* perform searches via GET, not POST so that we can mimic the safe-search functionality


== DONE ==

* limit the pages where glz_custom_fields adds it's JS & CSS in the head http://forum.textpattern.com/viewtopic.php?pid=202254#p202254

* jQuery annoying bug http://forum.textpattern.com/viewtopic.php?pid=184368#p184368

* input values filter before values are saved, exclude ' " from filtering:
  I just want to point out that there still is a problem with ' character (single quote). I can substitute it with apostrophe ', and that works fine, so there is a workaround. But for a client this could be a difficult thing to remember (the keyboard doesn't offer a stroke for that).

* search form needs a fieldset to validate

* more versatile search button for the filtering form
 
* I installed and everything is working fine, with one exception. It seems like I can't enter values with spaces inside (i.e., Moggio Torinese, as a single value for checkboxes). Similar problem for special characthers like '. I can use "Moggio Torinese" (with quotes), but then the whole string, " included, are shown in the content interface.
  I'm sure there is a way to have these character stored in the db without sql syntax problem, but I don't know what it is! :). Maurizio - maurizio.boscarol@gmail.com

* custom fields with - in them have problems when being filtered. Dale - mail@dalechapman.com

* I have found a slight bug when needing to get result according to just a category within a section your |<txp:glz_article /> tag does not return the proper results it just returns everything in the section.
<txp:category name="some_category" title="1"  section="house-plans" >
<txp:thumbnail id="a_image_id" />

</txp:category> - Dayne Larsen - dayne@barracudaproductions.com

* other fields for the search form (checkbox, radio, input) - Husain Hakim - husainhk@gmail.com

* idify label names & id - currently pages don't validate



== N/A ==

# TOO MUCH HASSLE FOR THIS - PROVIDING AN INTERFACE FOR THE PLUGIN IS NOT SOMETHING I WANT TO DO - TXP ON RAILS WILL ADDRESS THIS
* split custom fields with a custom delimiter, not only |

# STYLING ISSUE
* Is there any way to limit the length of the multiple choice areas? I have big names on some of them and they expand the admin layout. Gon√ßalo Dumas - goncalo.dumas@gmail.com
