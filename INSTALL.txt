== Installing glz_custom_fields v1.2.4

This version of the plugin works only on Textpattern 4.2.0, it is NOT backwards compatible. Let's install (upgrade to) glz_custom_fields v1.2.4:

1. BACKUP YOUR DATABASE. This is not optional. The plugin won't delete anything automatically, but if something goes wrong, you might end up deleting all your custom fields data.

2. Place the scripts/glz_custom_fields folder from the archive into your website's root folder. If you already have a scripts folder, just drop glz_custom_fields into it. You should end up with something similar:

.
|-- HISTORY.txt
|-- README.txt
|-- css.php
|-- files
|-- images
|   |-- 1.gif
|   `-- 2.gif
|-- index.php
|-- scripts
|   |-- glz_custom_fields <<< THIS IS THE FOLDER THAT YOU NEED TO ADD
`-- textpattern
    |-- checksums.txt
    |-- config-dist.php
    |-- config.php
    |-- css.php
...

3. Now delete your existing glz_custom_fields plugin, and install the new glz_custom_fields v1.2.4

4. Congratulations, you've been migrated to v1.2.4!



== Previous glz_custom_fields versions

There has been a private glz_custom_fields Google Group for some time now, and even though all discussion is happening on the TXP forum, this is a great place for downloading the plugin. If you need a previous version or just need the most up-to-date one, that is the place to go.
