"glz_custom_fields was finally launched (Limitless Pimped Custom Fields)":http://gerhardlazu.com/blog/50/glz_custom_fields-unveiled

This plugin sits under the Extensions tab in the back-end and gives your custom fields new life. You can finally have custom fields that are selects, multi-selects, checkboxes or radios (and the default input fields) and you can predefine some values for those. Rather then constantly typing in the same thing over and over again, just select or check it and you're set. It doesn't require any hacking of TXP, it's a straight install with instant gratification.

To see the plugin in action on a clean TXP 4.0.5 install, download this screencast: "glz_custom_fields_unveiled.mov(Limitless Pimped Custom Fields Screencast)":http://gerhardlazu.com/file_download/15/glz_custom_fields_unveiled.mov . It's a hefty 10MB file so you'll have to be patient. A few screenshots while you're waiting for the screencast to download:

As you might realize, this plugin took quiet some time to put together. Rather than setting a ransom fee and waiting for it to be met before making it public, "it's up for grabs for £10":http://gerhardlazu.com/blog/50/glz_custom_fields-unveiled (the equivalent of $20 or €15). The £10 will get you updates for life and, obviously, you can use it on as many websites as you want.

h2. *glz_custom_fields 1.1.3* - 5.03.2008

* an improved help (explanations in French, German, Spanish, Italian, Greek & Russian to follow shortly)
* a @jquery.js@ fix suggested by Sam Weiss. I gave up the idea of using the latest jquery from code.jquery.com becuse I found it to be too much hassle (permissions, offline websites etc.)
* @glz_custom_field@ and @glz_if_custom_field@ tags work nicely with custom fields that contain multiple values. Custom fields > 10 on single articles "need a hack to work":http://gerhardlazu.com/blog/51/glz_custom_fields-11-released
* plays nicely now with "sed_section_fields":http://txp-plugins.netcarving.com/plugins/section-fields
* TXP 4.0.6 compatible. If - for whatever reason - you didn't upgrade TXP to 4.0.6, make sure @jquery.js@ under the textpattern folder is at least 1.2. Upgrade to 4.0.6 *strongly* recommended.
* a custom field can be a multi-select as well (the only one remaining is textarea, planned for v1.3)
* @glz_if_custom_field@ is not a self closing tag, fixed Help which was stating otherwise
* custom field settings were no longer hidden in Advanced Preferences. It was a jQuery bug, selectors have slightly changed since jQuery 1.2
* ironed out all problems with filtering articles by custom field (supports multiple custom fields as well)
* bug that ignored empty values for text input custom fields > 10 when saving
* bug with deleting custom field sets on tables with prefixes

h2. Features for v1.2

* improved installation script (if custom set is different from text input, all values in @textpattern@ table for this custom field will be set as pre-defined values)
* set a default value for a custom field as per "this request":http://forum.textpattern.com/viewtopic.php?pid=157974#p157974
* @glz_search_custom_fields@ will raise an alert if no search criterion was selected
* @glz_search_custom_fields@ will have input fields, check and radio boxes as well as selects

h2. Features for v1.3

* textarea values (the only ones missing from v1.1)
* each custom field will have its own help where the admin can write usage instructions as per "this":http://forum.textpattern.com/viewtopic.php?pid=158009#p158009 and "this":http://forum.textpattern.com/viewtopic.php?pid=158122#p158122
* insert new values from within the article (e.g. an input field after the custom field pre-set values where users can specify new values, not defined yet). When saving the article, the new value(s) will be added automatically to the custom field values. Only unique values will be saved (duplicates will be removed).

TRIGGER WORDS:

* *|Image Categories|* (select with all existing image categories)
* *|File Categories|* (select with all existing image categories)
* *|Article Categories|* (will include the nice tree view that is available under Category tab)
* *|Schools Category Article|* (will return a list of all article titles belonging to "schools" category)
* *|Holiday Category Image|* (will return a list of all image names belonging to "holiday" category)
* *|Portfolio Category File|* (will return a list of all file names belonging to "portfolio" category)
* *|Listings Section|* (listings is the section name here and it will return all article titles belonging to that section)
* *|Date Picker|* (jQuery date picker as per "this request":http://gerhardlazu.com/blog/50/glz_custom_fields-unveiled#c000042)

h2. Features for v2.0

This will be a major overhaul from v1.x. It will be based on the principles of "xpattern":http://xpattern.net/. Rather than having custom field data in the @textpattern@ table, we'll have a separate table, @custom_fields_values@. This will improve the database structure when it comes to multiple values for individual custom fields (e.g. custom_1: value 1|value 2|value 3) and it will make installs smoother. Legacy data in custom_x columns will be preserved, the only thing that this plugin will directly modify is the data in @txp_prefs@ (although I might be able to come with a solution for that as well). Moving custom field values in a separate table opens the door to section-specific custom fields - I can already hear the ovations : ).

List of features:

* section-specific custom fields
* improved installation script (legacy data preservation)
