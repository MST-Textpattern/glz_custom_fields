<h3>Time &amp; Date Pickers</h3>
<p>They are pretty straightforward to use, no explanation needed. To set the required Javascript and styling properly, please refer to the <strong>INSTALL</strong> file that came with this plugin.</p>

<h3>Custom Scripts</h3>
<p>This is a rather complex and long sought for piece of functionality, please refer to the <strong>my_image.php</strong> file which contains inline explanations on how they should be used. The file came with the plugin, in the scripts/glz_custom_fields folder.</p>

<h3>Default values</h3>
<p>You can now define a single default value by adding curly brackets around a value like this <code>{default value}</code>. Support for multiple ones will be implemented at some point.</p>

<h3>Ranges</h3>
<p>If you want to define ranges, create a new custom field with the following name e.g. <code>Price range &amp;pound;(after)</code></p>
<ul>
<li><code>range</code> - this is really important and <strong>must</strong> be present for the range to work correctly</li>
<li><code>&amp;pound;</code> - don't use straight symbols (like &euro; or &pound;) but entity ones e.g. &amp;pound; &amp; &amp;euro; $ and &amp;cent are valid symbols.</li>
<li><code>(after)</code> - don't leave any spaces after e.g. $ and (after). This basically says where to add the measuring unit (be it a currency or something like m<sup>3</sup> etc.) - <code>(before)</code> is default.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ranges are defined 10-20, 21-30 etc. (no measuring units - they get pulled from the custom set name).</p>
