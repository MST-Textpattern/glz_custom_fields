Hi, Gerard: 

Here is the glz_custom_fields help spanish translation:

I have encoded it with the help HTML in order you can identify any part of text in any languaje (if you prefer an other format let me know). I have added the indication of "only in English, the author donÂ´t understand Spanish" in the e-mail contact line. 

Best regards.

Hi Gerhard!

Some time ago (somewhere in september 2007) we agreed that you will
add me to russian translators of your plugin as soon as version 1.0
will appear.

If you're still eager to contribute - tell me. Victor - nemiga@gmail.com
