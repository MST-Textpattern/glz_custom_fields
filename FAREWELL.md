FAREWELL
========

This will be the last glz_custom_fields release. It's just a patch
release so that you can use the plugin with the latest 4.4.x TXP, but
after this I will open-source the code and enable you to take ownership
of the plugin. It is a sad day, but if I'm totally honest, I have
diverged paths with TXP for a very long time now.

To put my decision in perspective, I get employed by top London
companies to transition systems like TXP to something more versatile. I
cannot continue working on the plugin and write 90% more code just to
make up for TXP's shortcomings. The next version of the plugin - if
there was just a thing - would have been bigger than TXP itself. A bold claim,
but if you think that there is a real need for plugins that run within
glz_custom_fields, that a more versatile distribution system would have
been a must and that an MVC framework is crucial to keep the code sane, you might
understand my claim. Oh, and I didn't mention anything about testing which
I would have not written a single line of code without.

So there you go, I am not going to continue development of glz_custom_fields
because I would need to create a whole new ecosystem around it. I do not want to
maintain anymore PHP code because it's illogical and frustrating when
you have been exposed to genuine object oriented programming in the form
of Ruby and Javascript for so many years.

I was reluctant to give glz_custom_fields up because I've invested so much time and
effort into it, and the response from the community has been fantastic.
Looking back, all the folks that have donated for the plugin are the
reason for which I have sticked with it for so long. You were all
fenomenal and I would have left it much earlier was it not for you.

In conclusion, I'm sorry chaps, but building another CMS doesn't sound
too appealing to me just now. TXP 5 sounds very promising and I know
Robert, Stef and the rest have great plans for it. I really hope that
they will manage to build something truly awesome and in line with the times.

As for me, I will continue my affair with Ruby and Javascript, I feel
most comfortable in their company.
