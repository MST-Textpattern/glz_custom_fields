This version of the plugin is for **Textpattern 4.4.x**,
it will most probably not work properly on previous versions.

#### BACKUP YOUR DATABASE

**This is not optional**. The plugin won't delete  anything automatically, 
but if something goes wrong, you might end up losing all your custom fields data.

#### PLUGINS FOLDER

Place the `glz_custom_fields` folder from the archive into your website's
plugins folder. You should end up with something similar to:

    .
    |-- HISTORY.txt
    |-- README.txt
    |-- index.php
    |-- ...........
    |-- plugins
    |   `-- glz_custom_fields <<< THIS IS THE FOLDER THAT YOU NEED TO ADD
    |-- ...........
    `-- textpattern
        |-- checksums.txt
        |-- config-dist.php
        |..................

#### INSTALL PLUGIN

Now delete your existing `glz_custom_fields` plugin, and install the
version included in this folder. That's it!
