h1. glz_custom_fields, unlimited super-special custom fields for Textpattern CMS

This plugin sits under the 'Extensions' tab in the back-end and gives your custom fields new life. You can finally have custom fields that are selects, multi-selects, checkboxes, radios and textareas - besides the default input fields. You can predefine values for custom fields and you can select a single default value (selects, multi-selects, checkboxes and radios only). Rather then constantly typing in the same thing over and over again, just select or check it and you're set.

The plugin doesn't require any hacking of TXP, it's a straight install with instant gratification. Also there's support for special custom fields as well. The first of them is the Date Picker custom field, but more will follow.
